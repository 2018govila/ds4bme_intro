Here's some homework to get you ready for the next class. Try to do the homework right after or before each class.

# Lecture 0

1. Get a colab account; create an empty notebook and play around with python in colab
2. Duplicate the first colab notebook from class.
3. Create a github account; create a repository; we'll email you a github classroom id

# Lecture 1

1. Fit a model to the kirby 21 dataset into colab. Do a scatterplot of the left telencephalon **(type 1 level 1) volume** by the right.
2. Create a vector of the left telencelphalon **(type 1 level 1) volume** values and the right. Demean each. Fit a regression through the origin model with the left telecephalon as the outcome and the right as the predictor. Also do the same with the left as the predictor and the right as the outcome. Plot the fitted lines on your scatterplot. To obtain the regression slope, both code it yourself and use a regression function in python.
3. Consider a regression through the origin model $Y=BX$. What would be the impact on the estimate of $B$ if we replaced $X$ by $cX$ where $c$ is a positive constant?
